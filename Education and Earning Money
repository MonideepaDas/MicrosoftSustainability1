I came across Sashi Tharoor Ji's video in youtube regarding education and earning. My understanding of that video is as follows:

A labour's child went to school and studied upto class 10th, but is he really going to get money using this education? The answer is NO(90%) and YES(10%).
No doubt he has learned maths, his mother toungue, english language and other subjects. These will help him in his life but can he earn money using this knowledge?
The answer is Yes, provided he/she opens tution classes and no if he/she has not opened tution classes.

A carpenter's son can learn the art of carpentry from his father and earn money.
A cobbler's son can learn the art of stitching shoes from his father and earn money.
The same lies with the vegetable vendors, small shop owners, painters, master craftsman, expert masions, foreman, construction supervisor, sweet makers, jewellers
etc etc.

Exceptions are also there, where a farmer's son becomes a big scientist/politician/actor/musician etc etc but it is a rare phenomenan. They are exceptional cases.
One in million may be or one in thousand may be.
